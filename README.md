# D&D Attributes Randomizer

This is a pet project I've created to learn basic REST and javascript. It rolls stats for D&D characters.

There's also a reroll option that works without updating the page. 

For each attribute, the app rolls 4 six-sided dice. The sum of the highest 3 rolls is the resulting value for that attribute.
